# The Eleven gems

A collection of simple gems by the teams at [The Eleven](http://www.theeleven.co.uk) to speed up development and keep code quality high.



## Gem Documentation

* [The Eleven Boilerplate](boilerplate.md)
* [Flexbox Grid](flex.md)




## Enviroment setup

Lint all scss and js code to keep everything consistent across our projects, this can be done via the command line or by installing a linter package to atom or sublime text.

In atom.io install the packages "language-ruby", "linter", "linter-jshint" & "linter-scss-lint"

*Use the scss linter config I'll provide here later to get the correct settings...*

This ensures all code stays readable and similar across all projects at The Eleven.
